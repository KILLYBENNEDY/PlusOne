Hello Sharon, here is where you'll find the instructions necessary to run our application at the 
end of sprint 3!

I'm going to assume that you already have meteor installed from reviewing our sprint 1 and if not then 
please refer to the sprint 1 readme file for instructions on how to install it to your computer.

We don't plan to update the project after sprint 3 so you should be able to use your temminal to:
	move into our repository, run meteor in the PlusOne directory, where it will give you a local link.
	Remember to put a /home at the end of the link it gives you.
	
Sadly our means of keeping a server up of the project are over as we are having trouble keeping the server 
	up in a permanent state. This means that you won't be able to use the match service to it's full potential
	and all data you use must be added to your local database. You will be able to create accounts and 
	be able to login/out and attempt to match with others BUT because this version is not on a server you
	will not be able to match with anybody but if you use the developer tools in the bottom left of the screen
	you can see that accounts are being added to the database along with a match que. 

KNOWN BUG THAT MAY EFFECT YOU. The login/out feature can be "strange" at certain resoultions. If you are unable
	to click the nav bar buttons then try changing the size of your webbrowser.
