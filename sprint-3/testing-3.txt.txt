Now that we have a basic working version of our project testing was more extensive.

When you look at the options available when you try to match you see that as of right now 
there are only two games to choose from and two additional options on what's your playstyle.

As such we tested to make sure that users only matched with users that also selected the
same options. 

The next set of testing is making sure that users are taken to correct webpage whenever they click
links. This also happens when users select the match button which takes them the results page. 

Other testing involves inserting data into the database including accounts and matchmaking 
information.
