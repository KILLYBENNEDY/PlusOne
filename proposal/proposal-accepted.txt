I have cloned your revised Plus1-repo repository on 2017-09-26.

You have converted your proposal bid to a PDF, and you have added a
client name and e-mail for a client who is not a member of the team, so
your proposal is now accepted.

Be sure that you follow the project handout guidelines as you start up
your project.

CORRECTION STILL NEEDED:
You still need to move your bid into a file named proposal-bid.pdf within
your proposal directory. Make sure that this is done before Project 
Milestone 2 is completed.

ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT COMMENT:
*   I am assuming that you listed these so-called "main features" here
    as reassurance that this proposed project can be broken up into
    appropriate iterations; note that you will be required to consider
    client input and feedback in determining which user stories will
    be implemented in each project sprint.

Project 1 milestone grade: 3.5 / 5.0
