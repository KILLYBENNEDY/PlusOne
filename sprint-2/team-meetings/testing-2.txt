Once again our Project is not at a point where many tests will be excessively helpful because the matchmaking system and login are
  still in progress of being completed BUT that doesn't mean we did not test the site itself.
  
Our main testing focus was put into the links that our website has and if they work as expected. For example the "create account"
  button on the home page should take you to the signin page and clicking the PlusOne in the top right of the navigation bar should
  take you back to the home page. Other links will take you through the site such as the "get started" button that will take you
  down the home page to the "create account" button.
