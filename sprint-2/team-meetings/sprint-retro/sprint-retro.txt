Discusion and Brainstorming:

While going through this sprint we found that we had seriously underestimated the amount
of time that we would put into the project which caused us to fail to complete some of 
our tasks. To improve our work ability we will attempt to have better communication and 
work on the project more often on weeknights. 

The information in this sprint-rero directory is accurate, to the best of my knowledge:
