Hello Sharon, here is where you'll find the instructions necessary to run our application at the end of sprint 2!

I'm going to assume that you already have meteor installed from reviewing our sprint 1 and if not then please refer to the sprint 1
  readme file for instructions on how to install it to your computer.

To make sure you are using our Sprint 2 iteration, please take into consideration the three Sprint2Main files in this folder.

I'll want you to carefully replace the contents of our Plus1-repo with these files in your local machine! To get there from the 
  starting point of Plus1-repo, change directories to PlusOne, and then change directories to client. Within client are the three 
  files I want you to change. Please carefully replace each of these files contents with the Sprint2 versions provided in this 
  directory. 

Once you save these changes to your local machine you should be able use a terminal to make way to the PlusOne directory. Once in 
  this directory you should be able to type out "meteor" into the terminal and once it finishes loading it should give you an address 
  you can enter to your web browser. Likely http://localhost:3000/home. Please make sure to add the /home if it does not instruct 
  you to do so.
