We discussed our plan for Wednesdays presentation of the project.
We talked about what we need to share with the class which includes
our home page and a login for users as well as our current CSS. We will be 
presenting off of Jared's laptop and will be switching off talking about different 
modules as well as our plans for a match making algorithm.
