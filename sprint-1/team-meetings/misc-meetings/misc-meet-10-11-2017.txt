Today we:

Back-end team, Connor Callison and  Jared McGreevy, successfully pair 
programmed the back end of our first major user story.
They implemented a meteor login page that is tied to our database. 

The front-end team, Kevin Josey and Bill Kennedy, are working with other 
team members to develop our color scheme. Jared had a dream about our project 
and we are basing our colors off of that. The front-end team worked on making
the login page pretty and actually visually functional.
