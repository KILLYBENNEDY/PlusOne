Sorry this late!!!

In order to run our project you'll have to download Meteor from this link: https://www.meteor.com/  
    Then you'll have to by run this command in your terminal: curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh    
    (This is in fact the OSX command) 
    You can check out Meteor here: https://www.meteor.com/install
    
From there you'll have to clone our repository to your system. Make your way to Plus1-repo and then move to the PlusOne 
    directory. Once there you need to enter the command: meteor        
    This process will take a while to install. Once it finishes it will give you a link that you can use on your 
    local machine, likely: http://localhost:3000 but we'll want you to add a /home to that link such as http://localhost:3000/home
